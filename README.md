On the surface, Quo is a customizable &mdash; some would say programmable &mdash; social
network status demultiplexer.  What it really is, underneath, is a string
processing pipeline.  But not everyone has to know that.

The *doc* directory holds assorted design and specification files.

Coming up: setup/installation instructions (when we actually have code),
contributing to the status function library collection, license, etc.
